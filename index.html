      <p>CS is a huge field encompassing huge topics that are awesome. Some subjects are used all around in the modern world. Wikipedia defines Computer Science as the "study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself ".These links
          are just a speck of dust compared to the huge amounts of websites, vidoes and articles out there. Have fun exploring these!

      <h2>The Art of DataScience</h2>
      <p>Hottest Kid in the block. This field has HUGE application in the modern world, especially with the rise of BigData and Machine Learning. Earlier only studied by mathematicians, this field has come back to life with the full power of python and R! Educate yourself with this divine field!</p>

    <div class="card" style="color:#123477">
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>All these three topics are huge in themselves and have powerful ideas that have huge impact in the real world. There are literally infinite amount of resources related to these topics online<br>
        What is covered here is just a sliver of what is out on the internet. These links might give a way to start your journey into these deep and beautiful fields. </p>

  <a href = 'pages/DSA.html'>
    <div class="card" style="color:#530d51">
        <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
        <p>An important topic in theoretical computer science. An age-old quest is undertaken by young undergrad students to learn this ancient art xD. An essential
          topic for an anyone in the Comp-Sci field. These were the tools used to build the entire computer world that we see today. Learn the lore of the old! 
      </p>

  <a href = 'pages/Science_Maths.html'>
    <div class="card" style="color:#123477">
        <h2>Physics and Mathematics</h2>
        <p>Apart from the 'computer-oriented-subjects' mentioned above, this is just a slight deviation to into other fields, physics and maths. Here we will explore 
          some very interesting topics and fundamental paradigms of maths and physics and people who contributed to these fields. Just an another toy for the curious mind!

  <a href = 'pages/Elec.html'> 
    <div class="card" style="color:#530d51">
        <h2>Electronics</h2>
        <p>Another important field in the current world. This field is currently one of the techonological backbones of our civilization. Though 'technically'
          this comes under the field of physics, the subject is so much akin to engineering. Helpful for a budding electronics engineer.

        <h2> Awesome people!</h2>
        <p>These are some really cool people I found on the internet. Some of them are truly men( and women) of intellect. Their personal websites and blogs are here. Some
          have inspired me. These people really are good disseminators of knowledge. Hope, any of you find their blogs as influenciable and enjoyable as I did!

  <a href = 'pages/github.html'>
    <div class="card" style="color:#530d51">
        <h2>Informative Github Pages</h2>
        <p>This is more like a refined 'Awesome' github pages that I think are relevant for a budding techincal enginner. One can learn a lot from browsing through these.
          There do not have links to specific topics, per se, but a general miscellaneous collection of information.

  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <h3><i> Why this website?</i></h3>
  <p > The main goal of this website was to build something useful, productive. Something that will help others getting started with something
    they need help with. We could have also done something like a Reddit,Quora,Imgur post or even a tweet-thread, but a website will remain forever,
    it serves as a stark example of how much hard work it takes to learn something and to use it to do useful work. 
  </p>
  
  <h3><i> How to use this?</i></h3>
  <p> This is a pretty much simple website with no much overhead required to read and parse through this. The main webpage contains links that can be accessed directly,
    provided that the orignal website doesn't get taken down.
   Anymore links or suggestions are always welcome! </p>
   
   <h3><i>Credits</i></h3>
   <p>I should thank <a class="link" href="https://github.com/DherajSK">Dheraj S K</a> and <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Shashank54">Shashank Bhat</a> for helping me make 
     this website. I also would like to give credits to all those people who were creators of the websites and links presented above.
